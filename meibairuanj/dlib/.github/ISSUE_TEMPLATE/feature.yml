        It is OK to suggest interesting improvements to dlib, even if you are not volunteering to implement them.
        **However, the issue tracker is not a code writing service, do not ask for someone to write code for you**.
        E.g. Do not ask for feature improvements to the example programs.
        **If there is some feature improvement you want in an example program then it's up to you to write it**.
